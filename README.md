# Alexa-Skill-Set
I am updating this repository with my Alexa Skill sets that I create in my Amazon developer console. It's pretty basic JSON that is used to create these alexa skills and I would be working and updating this repo.

For using Alexa developer console:

1. Update your AMAZON Developer account
2. Go to Alexa Tab
3. Open and create your new skill
4. Paste my codes to see them in action in various simulations.
